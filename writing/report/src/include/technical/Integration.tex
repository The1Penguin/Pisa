\section{Integration of subsystem}\label{sec:integration-of-subsystem}
Pisa has been incorporated into a macro for use within Lean.
A user utilizes \lean{#pisa} within a namespace.
They give an optional natural number which regulates the term size, and the identifiers they are interested in.
This provides the user with a Language Server Protocol (LSP) code action.
The code action will begin by fetching the definitions as explained in \cref{sec:lean-interface}.
With these definitions, Pisa is called with a given size, and then the definitions are streamed to Pisa's process.
After some time, the output of Pisa is parsed and then added to the file where the macro was called.
